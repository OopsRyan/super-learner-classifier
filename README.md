# super-learner-classifier

The key of this classifier, a stacked ensembling technique, was inspired from van der Laan's paper on super leaner. 

The super learner is implemented based on the base estimator of sci-kit learn platform, so that this classifier can be compatible with sci-kit learn's modules, like metrics and grid-search.

More details can be found in the jupyter notebook and the assignment instructions.

[Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist "Zalando's Fashion MNIST") was used as the dataset.

Below is the super learner's structure.
