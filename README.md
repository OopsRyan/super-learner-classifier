# super-learner-classifier

The key of this classifier, a stacked ensembling technique, was inspired from van der Laan's paper on super leaner. 

The super learner is implemented based on the base estimator of sci-kit learn platform, so that this classifier can be compatible with sci-kit learn's modules, like metrics and grid-search.

More details can be found in the jupyter notebook and the assignment instructions.
